A project for an Object Oriented Programming class at NSCC. This console app features an unbeatable Tic Tac Toe game. This logic for making it unbeatable is a simple scoring algorithm on each open tile, then choosing the tile with the highest or lowest score based on whether the computer went first. The algorithm is described in an image below. This algorithm is preferable because, at-least in the first few moves, it is more efficient than a brute force recursive search.
