A project for an Object Oriented Programming class at NSCC. This console app features an unbeatable Tic Tac Toe game. The logic for making it unbeatable is a simple scoring algorithm on each open tile, then choosing the tile with the highest or lowest score based on whether the computer went first. This algorithm is preferable because, at-least in the first few moves, it is more efficient than a brute force recursive search.
